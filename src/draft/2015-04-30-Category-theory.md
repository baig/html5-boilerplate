Object in a Category don't form a Set.
If they do form a Set, then the Category is Small.
If they don't form a Set, then the Category is Large.
Morphisms in a Category form a Set called a hom-set.

Is Category similar to Group?
A Group is a Monoid and has an Inverse.
In a Group, you can compose anything with anything.
In a Category, you can't.

A Groupoid is a Category in which every arrow has an inverse.
It's not a Group, it's more than a group.

Categories usually don't take into account the notion of time.
Computation does care about time.
If something takes too long to compute, it's practically useless to us.


A lot of categories come from some model.


What are types?
Simplest model for type: Sets of Values, Function between sets
Another model for types: Objects as Values, Morphisms as functions
