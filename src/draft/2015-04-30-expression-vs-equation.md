Consider the following figure:

$$ 2 + 3 = 1 + 4 $$
   -----   ----- expressions
   ------------- equation

The whole thing is an equation because it contains the equal sign.

$2 + 3$ is an expression.
In this equation, it may also be referred to as the *left hand side (LHS)* of
the equation.
Remember that the left hand side itself is an *expression*.

Similarly, $1 + 4$ is an expression too.
In this equation, it may also be referred to as the *right hand side (RHS)* of
the equation.
Like LHS, right hand side is an expression as well.

How are expressions and equations related?
Anything that *equates* two or more expressions is considered an equation.

Remember expressions are to be *evaluated*.
