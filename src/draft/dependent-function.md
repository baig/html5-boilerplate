# Dependent Functions

Start from the concept of Dependent Variable in statistics.


[Dependent Variable](http://www.mathwords.com/d/dependent_variable.htm)

"A variable that depends on one or more other variables."

"For equations such as y = 3x â€“ 2, the dependent variable is y."

"The value of y depends on the value chosen for x."

"Usually the dependent variable is isolated on one side of an equation."

"Formally, a dependent variable is a variable in an expression, equation, or
function that has its value determined by the choice of value(s) of other
variable(s)."
