# Yoneda Lemma/Embedding

Named after [Nobuo Yoneda], a Japanese mathematician and computer scientist.

## Locally small category
- A category is *locally small* if a collection of morphisms between any two
objects forms a set.
- There are things in mathematics that are too big to be sets.

"In category theory, when we say one category is “like” another category,
we usually mean that there is a mapping between the two.
For this mapping to be meaningful, it should preserve the structure of the
category.
So not only every object from one category has to be mapped into an object from
another category, but also all morphisms must be mapped correctly — meaning they
should preserve composition.
Such a mapping has a name: it's called a functor."

"A functor is a mapping between categories that preserves their structure.
The structure of a category is defined by the way its morphisms compose."

"The best insight I can offer is that a natural transformation works on
structure, while a general morphism works on contents.
The naturality condition ensures that it doesn’t matter if you first rearrange
the structure and then the content, or the other way around.
Or, in other words, that a natural transformation doesn’t touch the content."
