Consider the following:

```
2 + 3 = 1 + 4
```

This is an equation because it contains the equal sign.

`2 + 3` is an expression.
In this equation, it may also be referred to as the *left hand side (LHS)* of
the equation.
Remember that the left hand side itself is an *expression*.

Similarly, `1 + 4` is an expression too.
In this equation, it may also be referred to as the *right hand side (RHS)* of
the equation.
Like LHS, right hand side is an expression as well.

How are expressions and equations related?
Anything that *equates* two or more expressions is considered an equation.

Remember expressions are to be *evaluated*.
