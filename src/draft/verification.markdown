# Verificationism Then and Now

The term verificationism is used in two different ways:

  - The first is in relation to the verification principle of meaning.
    We usually and rightly associate this relation with the logical empiricists.
    Although, in reality, it derives from Wittgenstein, and
  - The second is in relation to the theory of meaning for intuitionistic logic.
    That has been developed, beginning of course with Brouwer, Heyting and
    Kolmogorov (BHK) in the twenties and early thirties but in much more detail
    lately, particularly in connection with intuitionistic type theory.

Natural Questions:

  - How these two forms of verificationism are related to one another?
  - Was the verificationism that we had in the thirties a kind of forerunner of
    what we have now, or was it something entirely different?

I would like to discuss this question by considering a very particular problem,
the problem whether there might exist undecidable propositions/unsolvable problems/unanswerable questions (Schlick's interests).

$$ n > 2 $$

Abstractly:

  - Is it conceivable that some propositions/problems may be such that they just
    cannot be decided/settled
  - Is it conceivable that a proposition may be such that it can neither be proved
    nor be disproved, or, that it can neither be
  - Is it conceivable that a proposition may be such that it can neither be known
    to be true nor be known to be false?

Concretely:

  - Is it conceivable that $x^n + y^n$ is in reality different from $z^n$ for
    arbitrary natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ when $n > 2$, but that we are somehow blocked
    from knowing it, so that all our attempts at trying to prove this will be in
    vain, or is that conceptually excluded meaning if this cannot be known to be so,
    then it is actually false?
  - Is it conceivable that there are as a matter of fact infinitely many twin
    primes, although we cannot prove it by any means, or is that conceptually
    excluded?

This is a question about the proper conceptual connections between the notions
in terms of which it is formulated.

These notions are roughly the notions of proposition, truth, falsity, knowledge, and possibility.

The notion of possibility enters in the guise of the verb *can* in the
formulation of the question: might there exist propositions which can neither be
known to be true nor be known to be false?

A definite answer to this question cannot be given unless we decide upon a
sufficiently precise interpretation of these notions.

I will give an intuitionistic interpretation of these notions.

Under intuitionistic interpretation, the question can be definitely answered in the negative.

The notion of judgement precedes the notions of proposition, truth, and falsity
in order of conceptual priority.

The notions of proposition, truth, and falsity are associated with the three
forms of judgement:
  - A is a proposition
  - A is true
  - A is false.

There are many other forms of judgement e.g. forms of hypothetical and general judgement.

What is the difference between a general and a hypothetical judgement?

Type theory has even more elaborate forms of judgement.

## What is a judgement?

Well, the notion of judgement is an essentially epistemic notion, which means
that it is connected with the notion of knowledge.

What is an epistemic notion?

I think that the most natural explanation is to say that the meaning of a
judgement is fixed by laying down what it is that you must know in order to have
the right to make the judgement in question.

In another formulation, a judgement is defined simply by what knowledge it
embodies: a judgement is a piece of knowledge, and you have to clarify what knowledge.

Now connected with the notion of judgement is the notion of evidence or being
evident, just as the notion of proposition is coupled with the notion of truth.

A judgement is evident if it has been known or demonstrated or justified or warranted.

The choice of terminology does not matter as far as the logical analysis is
concerned, because it is solely the structure into which they fit which is
important, and the structure is one and the same irrespectively of whether
I choose to express myself using one or the other of these terms.

After all, with the possible exception of known, they are all metaphorical in
nature: just as demonstrated is connected with shown, evident is connected with seen, whereas justified and
warranted (Dewey's preferred terms) both seem to be of legal origin.

We also have the notion of truth of a judgement.

It is wise and common to use a different word with judgements because we also
have the more well-known notion of the truth of a proposition.

The natural choice is to use correctness or objective correctness in connection with judgements.

**What is the connection between the notions of evidence and truth for judgements?**
*A judgement is true or correct, by definition, if it can be made evident.*

True or correct for judgements means evidenceable/knowable/demonstrable/justifiable/warrantable.

This analysis of the notion of truth of a judgement in terms of the notions of
evidence and possibility validates the Cartesian criterion of truth.

Cartesian criteria says that, if a judgement is evident, then it is true.

In the classical formulation, *quod clare et distincte percipio verum est*, what I clearly and
distinctly perceive is true, true in the sense of correct.

Indeed, that principle becomes a consequence of my explanation of the notion of
truth of a judgement and an even more basic principle, namely, the principle
that the scholastics formulated as *ab esse ad posse valet consequentia (illatio)*.

And why?

Because evident means actually known and true means knowable, that is, possibly
known, and hence, by the principle that, if something is actual, then it is
possible, the Cartesian criterion follows: it becomes simply an instance of the
*ab esse ad posse* principle.


## What is a proposition?

Once this question is posed, you see immediately the connection with the general
explanation of the notion of judgement that I have just given, and why that
explanation had to come first.

As I said, a judgement is defined
by laying down what it is that you must know in order to have the right to make it,
and to ask: what is a proposition? is precisely to ask what you must know in order
to have the right to make a judgement of the form A is a proposition, or, equivalently,
what knowledge is embodied in a judgement of this form.

And here I am going
directly to the intuitionistic explanation of the notion of proposition, although we
know that it is a relatively late one.

So recall the explanations of the meanings of the
logical constants, the connectives and the quantifiers, given by Brouwer,
Heyting and Kolmogorov: they all follow the common pattern that, whatever the
logical constant may be, an explanation is given of what a proof of a proposition formed by means
of that logical constant looks like, that is, what is the form, and, more precisely,
canonical or direct form, of a proof of a proposition which has that specific logical
constant as its outermost sign.

It is clear from this what ought to be the general
explanation of what a proposition is, namely, that a proposition is defined by stipulating
how its proofs, more precisely, canonical or direct proofs, are formed.

And, if we take
the rules by means of which the canonical proofs are formed to be the introduction
rules, I mean, if we call those rules introduction rules as Gentzen did, then his suggestion
that the logical constants are defined by their introduction rules is entirely correct, so
we may rightly say that a proposition is defined by its introduction rules.

Now what I would like to point out is that this is an explanation which could just
as well be identified with the verification principle, provided that it is suitably inter-
preted.

*Verification principle says that the meaning of a proposition is the method of its verification.*

The trouble with that principle, considered as a formula, or as a slogan, is
that it admits of several different interpretations, so that there arises the question: how is it to be interpreted?

Actually, there are at least three natural interpretations of it.
  - On the first of these, the means of verifying a proposition are simply identified with the introduction rules for
    it, and there is then nothing objectionable about Wittgensteinâ€™s formula, provided
    that we either, as I just did, replace method by means, which is already plural in
    form, or else make a change in it from the singular to the plural number: the
    meaning of a proposition is the method s of its verification.
    Interpreted in this way, it simply
    coincides with the intuitionistic explanation of what a proposition is, or, if you
    prefer, the Gentzen version of it in terms of introduction rules.
    For instance, using
    this manner of speaking, there are two methods of verifying a disjunctive proposition,
    namely, the two rules of disjunction introduction, and absurdity is defined by
    stipulating that it admits of no method of verification.

  - A second interpretation of the term method of verification, perhaps the most
    natural one, is to use it as a synonym for proof of a proposition, because what is a
    proof of a proposition on the intuitionistic conception?
    Well, in general, it need not
    be in canonical form, that is, it need not have one of the forms displayed in the
    meaning explanation of the proposition in question, but a proof in general is at least
    a method which, when it is executed, yields a canonical proof of the proposition as
    result, so it is very natural to call a proof a method of verification, more precisely, a
    method of direct, or canonical, verification.
    But, of course, we are then using the term "method of verification" in a
    sense which is entirely different from the first one, and which is in
    conflict with the verification principle.

  - Now, as a matter of fact, it is in neither of these two senses that the term method
    of verification was used by Schlick and the Vienna Circle.
    For them, method of verification meant method of empirical verification or
    falsification, that is, method of
    testing by observation whether the proposition is true or false.
    So a method of
    verification was for them simply a decision method, where in addition it is required
    that the decision, or testing, is to be on empirical grounds.
    However, in the case of
    pure mathematics, it is excluded that it could be an empirical testing, so, if we
    remove that empiricist element, which was absent, by the way, from Wittgensteinâ€™s own discussions of the verification principle, what remains is the idea that a method of verification is a method of veri- or falsifying the proposition, that is, a method of
    deciding whether it is true or false, and such a method is for the intuitionist the same
    as a proof of A v Â¬ A , where A is the proposition in question.
    Indeed, a proof of A v Â¬A is a method which, when executed, yields a
    canonical proof of A v Â¬ A as result, and, by the definition of disjunction,
    a canonical proof of A v Â¬ A consists either of a proof of A, together with
    the information that it is a proof of the left disjunct, or of a proof of
    Â¬A, together with the information that it is a proof of the right disjunct,
    so that we can read off which of the two alternatives is the case.
    
To sum up, the
outcome of this discussion of the verification principle is that, on the first of the
three interpretations that we have considered, the verification principle of meaning
is fine as a formulation of what a proposition is on the intuitionistic conception, but
that is not the interpretation that was actually given to it by the logical empiricists.

Correlated with the verification principle of meaning is the verification principle
of truth, which explains what it means for a proposition in the sense that has just
been made precise to be true, and the explanation is now very simple, namely, that
A is true is taken to mean that there exists a proof of A , a proof which need not
necessarily be direct or canonical.

The term proof is of course synonymous with verification here.

This definition of the notion of truth of a proposition reduces it to two
notions, namely, the notion of proof or verification and the notion of existence,
and it is because of this that it is very natural to use the term verificationism in
connection with the theory of meaning for intuitionistic logic: the term verification
is used to stress the fact that the notion of truth is not taken as a primitive notion, like
in a truth conditional theory of meaning, but is rather defined in terms of an underlying
notion of verification by the principle that A is true if there exists a verification of
A.

Now, if A is a proposition, then we know of course what a proof of A is, because
a proposition is defined precisely by stipulating how its proofs are formed, so we
cannot know a proposition without knowing what a proof of the proposition is, but
there remains the question how the notion of existence here is to be understood.

Normally, we take the notion of existence to be expressed by means of the existential
quantifier, and we have a careful explanation of what the existential quantifier means,
but it is very clear that the notion of existence as it enters here cannot possibly be
expressed by means of the existential quantifier, so we have to give a direct
explanation of what we mean by existence here.

According to the general explanation of what a judgement is, this means that we have to lay down what it is that you must know in
order to have the right to judge that A is true, that is, that there exists a proof of A, and
the intuitionist explanation is that to know that there exists a proof of A is to have
constructed, or found, a proof of A, that is, to have a proof of A in your possession.


## The notion of Falsity

The notion of falsity has an explanation which is entirely analogous to that of
the notion of truth: a proposition A is false, by definition, if
there exists a disproof, or refutation, of A.

Now I need not say anything more about
the notion of existence here, because I have already done that in my discussion
of the notion of truth, but, instead, it remains to explain the notion of disproof, or
refutation, which is a new notion.

And here the explanation is the following: a disproof of a proposition A is a
hypothetical proof of absurdity from A.

This definition of the notion of disproof presupposes that, among our propositions, we have the
special proposition, called absurdity, which is by definition false.

Like any other
proposition, its meaning is fixed by giving the introduction rules for it, and in this
case there are no introduction rules: in the case of disjunction, we have two
introduction rules, but, in the case of absurdity, we have zero introduction rules, so the
meaning of absurdity is fixed by stipulating that it has no canonical proof and therefore no proof at all.

Now, once we have introduced absurdity, symbolized by âŠ¥ , we
can explain the notion of disproof by saying that a disproof of a proposition A is a
hypothetical proof of âŠ¥ from A , or, what amounts to the same, a function which
takes a proof of A into a proof of âŠ¥ . So, in type theoretical notation, a disproof f of
a proposition A is an object of the function type (A)âŠ¥:

    f:(A)âŠ¥.

Of course, this constructive notion of falsity, defined in terms of the notion of
disproof, or refutation, goes back to Brouwer: to know that a proposition A is false
is to have constructed, or found, a refutation of A , that is, to have a refutation of A in
your possession.

Once the notion of falsity has been constructed, there arises the question as to
what the formal laws are that govern its use. Actually, there are three such laws, and,
formulated in natural deduction style, they read as follows. First of all, in addition
to the usual assumption rule, which allows us to assume a given proposition to be
true, there is a new assumption rule which allows us to assume a given proposition
to be false instead. Second, if we have proved, from the assumption that a proposition
A is true, that âŠ¥ is true, we may conclude that A is false,

     (A true)
     âŠ¥ true
    ---------,
     A false

and, third, if one and the same proposition A has been demonstrated to be both true
and false, we may conclude that âŠ¥ is true,

    A true   A false
    ----------------
         âŠ¥ true

So these are the three formal laws of falsity, provided now that you introduce the
notion of falsity into your object language, which is not common, of course: normally,
we express the falsity of A by the truth of Â¬ A . Then the rule of assuming a proposi-
tion to be false becomes a special case of the usual rule of assuming a proposition
to be true, and the two remaining laws of falsity reduce to the negation laws. Now,
from these new rules of falsity, it follows immediately that a proposition A is false
if and only if Â¬ A is true, which is to say that the two rules

A false                        Â¬A true
-------,                       --------,
Â¬A true                        A false 

are valid as derived rules, and this is of course why it works to de fi ne the falsity of A as
the truth of Â¬ A , but, nevertheless, falsity is a notion in its own right, and deserves to be
treated as such, even if you can do without it from a purely formal point of view.

Now the notion of knowledge, the fourth on our list of notions to be elucidated,
I have already dealt with in connection with the notion of judgement: my discussion
of the notion of judgement and the notions of evidence and truth, or correctness, of
a judgement was a treatment in brief of the epistemic notions that are needed,
whereas the notions of proposition, truth and falsity are non-epistemic in nature.
And now there remains on our list only the notion of possibility, which I have
already used in defining the notion of truth of a judgement as knowability. Concerning
this notion of possibility, I have nothing more to say, except that it is the notion
of logical possibility, or possibility in principle, as opposed to real, or practical,
possibility, which takes resources and so on into account. It is something that was
repeated over and over again by Schlick that, in the verification principle, it
is absolutely necessary to understand the â€“able in verifiable as logically possible, or
possible in principle, to verify, and, although I am not adhering to the verification
principle as interpreted by Schlick, I am as dependent as he was on the notion of
logical possibility, or possibility in principle, so I will allow myself to use it without
further ado in this discussion.

Now the ordinary logical laws, the laws of propositional and predicate logic, are
properly characterized as laws of truth, laws that allow us to derive consequences,
which say that one proposition, the consequent, is true provided certain other propo-
sitions, the antecedents, are true. It is therefore very natural to ask, once we have
seen the correspondence between the non-epistemic notions and the epistemic ones,
in particular, between the notion of truth of a proposition and the notion of truth of
a judgement, whether there are some general laws that we can formulate for judge-
ments and their truth, which means knowability as we have seen, and indeed there
are three such laws. If the ordinary, object linguistic logical laws are characterized
as laws of truth, it is natural to refer to these as metalinguistic laws, or laws of
knowability. Now the first of these laws is so trivial that maybe it should not be
spelled out as a separate law, but I will do it anyway.

First Law (re fl ection) . If the premises of a valid inference are knowable, then so is
the conclusion.

The justi fi cation is simple: if the premises of a valid inference are knowable, or
demonstrable, then it is clearly possible to demonstrate, that is, to get to know, the
conclusion by first demonstrating the premises and then applying the very inference
that is under consideration, the one that is valid by assumption.

The first law, if we choose to call it a law, allows us to lift every object linguistic
rule of inference into a metalinguistic rule of inference. So, instead of saying, in an
object linguistic mode: J 1 , ..., J n , therefore J , we say, in a metalinguistic mode: if J1,...,Jn are knowable, then J is knowable. For example, the usual rule of conjunction introduction

    A true   B true
    ---------------,
      A & B true

is lifted into the metalinguistic law which says: if two propositions A and B can both
be known to be true, then A & B can be known to be true.

Second Law (absolute consistency) . Absurdity cannot be known to be true.

In other words, the judgement

    âŠ¥ true

is unknowable. And how do you see this? Well, as always in the case of an axiom,
by re fl ection on the meanings of the terms involved. Remember how absurdity was
defined: like any other proposition, it was defined by its introduction rules, and, in
the particular case of absurdity, there are none. This means that there is no canonical
proof of absurdity, and, since an arbitrary, possibly noncanonical proof is a method,
or program, which yields a canonical proof as result, there is no noncanonical proof
either. Hence, it is impossible to know a proof of absurdity, and, by the definition of
truth, this amounts to the same as saying that it is impossible to know that absurdity
is true.

It is noteworthy that the absolute consistency is more basic even than the law of
contradiction, in the sense that the law of contradiction follows as a corollary from it.

Corollary (law of contradiction) . One and the same proposition cannot both be
known to be true and be known to be false.

Put differently, the two judgements A true and A false, which presuppose A to be
a proposition, are not both knowable, or correct. To see why, remember that

    A true   A false
    ----------------
        âŠ¥ true

is a valid rule of inference: it is the second of the two rules of inference associated
with the notion of falsity. Hence, by the first law of knowability, if the judgements
A true and A false are both knowable, then so is the judgement âŠ¥ true. But that is
excluded by the second law, so A true and A false cannot both be knowable, or correct,
which is precisely what the law of contradiction states.

Now, just as the law of contradiction follows as a corollary from the second law,
the answer to the question with which I began this talk will follow as a corollary
from the third law of knowability.

Third Law (unknowability of truth entails knowability of falsity) . If a proposition
cannot be known to be true, then it can be known to be false .

Since, as we have seen, the judgement A false, where A is a proposition, is inter-
derivable with the judgement Â¬ A true, the third law may just as well be rendered: if a proposition cannot be known to be true, then its negation can be known to be true.
What is more, this is the only formulation available if you choose to de fi ne falsity in
terms of negation and truth rather than to take it as a primitive notion. And how do you
convince yourself of the third law? Well, let a proposition, say A , be given, and suppose
that the judgement A true is unknowable. By the definition of truth, knowing that A is
true amounts to the same as knowing a proof of A . Hence, using type theoretic notation,
the assumption that A cannot be known to be true means that the epistemic situation

    a:A

cannot arise: it is impossible that we arrive at a judgement of this form. Now, from
this negative piece of information, I have to get something positive, namely, I have
to show that we actually can know a refutation of A , and a refutation of A is a hypothetical proof of âŠ¥ from A , or, equivalently, a function which takes a proof of A into a proof of âŠ¥ .
The argument is this: we simply introduce a hypothetical proof of â”´
from A , call it R . In type theoretical terms, this means that we introduce an object R
of the function type ( A ) âŠ¥ , in symbols,

    R:(A)âŠ¥,

and it only remains for us to make this judgement (in fact, axiom) evident. So what
does it mean? Well, by the semantical explanation of the function type, it means that
R (a) : âŠ¥ provided that a : A , and, moreover, that R (a) = R (b) : âŠ¥ provided that a = b :
A . Thus, the crucial judgement R : ( A ) âŠ¥ may be considered as a licence to infer by
the two rules

      a:A                     a=b : A
    --------,             ----------------,
     R(a):âŠ¥                R(a) = R(b):âŠ¥


which are both vacuously valid. This is obvious in the case of the first rule, since, by
assumption, its premise can never be demonstrated, and it is equally obvious in the
case of the second rule, since its premise carries with it the two presuppositions a :
A and b : A , which can never be demonstrated either. So we may safely judge R to
be an object of type ( A ) âŠ¥ , that is, to be a refutation of the proposition A . This
fi nishes the explanation why a proposition which cannot be known to be true, in
recompense, can be known to be false. Observe how similar it is to the justi fi cation
of the rule of absurdity elimination, the rule that was referred to as ex falso sequitur
quodlibet by the scholastic logicians.

Corollary (law of excluded middle) . There are no propositions which can neither
be known to be true nor be known to be false.

In short, there are no absolutely undecidable propositions. And why does this
follow from the third law? Well, suppose that we had a proposition which could
neither be known to be true nor be known to be false. Then, in particular, it cannot
be known to be true, so, by the third law, it can instead be known to be false. But that
contradicts the assumption that the proposition could not be known to be false either.
So the answer to the question with which I began this talk â€“ might there exist absolutely undecidable propositions? â€“ is in the negative, and this is precisely the conclusion, in both senses of the word, that I wanted to reach.

Let me just fi nish by comparing the preceding treatment with the way in which
absolutely undecidable propositions were excluded by Schlick. For him, it was
much easier, because a proposition was for him defined by its method of verification,
where method of verification was interpreted as method of veri- or falsifying the
proposition, that is, as method of deciding whether the proposition is true or false:
if it has no clear method of verification, the alleged proposition simply is not a
proposition, that is, it is not meaningful. So Schlick's interpretation of the verification
principle actually validates the law of excluded middle in its positive formulation,
which says that every proposition can either be known to be true or be known to be
false, and clearly so: simply execute the method of verification, or decision method,
that de fi nes the proposition in question. As concerns the foundations of mathematics,
Schlick was most strongly in fl uenced by Hilbert, and at least one source of his inter-
est in the question of unsolvable problems must have been Hilbertâ€™s mathematical
problems paper from 1900, in which he just states as an axiom, or a conviction,
which every mathematician certainly shares, that every mathematical problem can
be solved, that is, that every mathematical proposition can either be proved or be
disproved. Schlick's way of justifying that axiom was to say that a proposition is
defined by its method of verification, that is, by its decision method, and hence, by
being a proposition, it is necessarily decidable. Here we see that we have had to go a
considerably more roundabout way to reach the weaker conclusion that there are no
absolutely undecidable propositions. It is the price that we have had to pay for being
able to make sense of quanti fi cation over in fi nite domains, like the domain of the natu-
ral numbers. There are many propositions whose meanings we understand perfectly
well although we do not known how to decide whether they are true or false.

## Postscript, January 2012

As a result of having reread the preceding article after seventeen years, I have
become dissatisfied with the treatment of what I called the third law and its corollary,
and therefore propose the following amended treatment.

Third Law (unknowability of truth entails falsity) . From the unknowability of the
truth of a proposition, its falsity may be inferred.

Since, as we have seen, the judgement A false is interderivable with the judgement Â¬
A true, the third law may just as well be rendered: from the unknowability of the
truth of a proposition, the truth of its negation may be inferred. What is more, this is
the only formulation available if you choose to de fi ne falsity in terms of negation
and truth rather than to take it as a primitive notion. And how do you convince your-
self of the third law? Well, let a proposition, say A , be given, and suppose that the
judgement A true is unknowable. By the definition of truth, knowing that A is true
amounts to the same as knowing a proof of A . Hence, using type theoretic notation,
the assumption that A cannot be known to be true means that the epistemic situation

    a:A

cannot arise: it is impossible that we arrive at a judgement of this form. Now, from
this negative piece of information, I have to get something positive, namely, I have
to construct a refutation of A , and a refutation of A is a hypothetical proof of â”´
from A , or, equivalently, a function which takes a proof of A into a proof of âŠ¥ .
The argument is this: we simply introduce a hypothetical proof of âŠ¥ from A , call it
R . In type theoretical terms, this means that we introduce an object R of the function
type ( A ) âŠ¥ , in symbols,

    R:(A)âŠ¥,

and it only remains for us to make this judgement (in fact, axiom) evident. So
what does it mean? Well, by the semantical explanation of the function type, it
means that R (a) : âŠ¥ provided that a : A, and, moreover, that R (a) = R (b) : âŠ¥ provided
that a = b : A. Thus, the crucial judgement R : ( A ) âŠ¥ may be considered as a licence
to infer by the two rules

     a:A                    a = b : A
   --------,            ------------------,
    R(a):âŠ¥               R(a) = R(b) : âŠ¥

which are both vacuously valid. This is obvious in the case of the first rule, since, by
assumption, its premise can never be demonstrated, and it is equally obvious in the
case of the second rule, since its premise carries with it the two presuppositions a :
A and b : A , which can never be demonstrated either. So we may safely judge R to
be an object of type ( A ) âŠ¥ , that is, to be a refutation of the proposition A . It now only
remains to make the inference

     R:(A)âŠ¥
    ---------
     A false

in order to reach the desired conclusion that A is false. This fi nishes the explanation
why, from the unknowability of the truth of a proposition, we may infer its falsity.
Observe how similar it is to the justi fi cation of the rule of absurdity elimination, the
rule that was referred to as ex falso (sequitur) quodlibet by the scholastic logicians.

Corollary (law of excluded middle) . There are no propositions which can neither
be known to be true nor be known to be false.

In short, there are no absolutely undecidable propositions. Whichever way it is
formulated, however, the negative existential: there are no ..., as it occurs in either
of the two formulations, needs careful explanation, since it cannot be expressed by
means of an ordinary negated existential quantifier. What the corollary says, in
detail, is that it is impossible to give a counterexample to the law of excluded middle
in its positive formulation: every proposition can either be known to be true or be
known to be false, which Brouwer correctly identi fi ed with Hilbertâ€™s solvability
axiom. Such a counterexample would have to be a proposition for which it had been
established that it can neither be known to be true nor be known to be false. What
the corollary says is therefore that the epistemic situation

    A prop,
    (A true) unknowable,
    (A false) unknowable,

cannot arise. To see why, first apply the third law to the first two judgements in order
to reach the conclusion A false, from which Â¬ A true follows by the first of the two
rules

     A false         Â¬A true
    ---------,      ---------.
     Â¬A true         A false

Then use the second of these rules to conclude, from the unknowability of A
false, that Â¬ A true is likewise unknowable. A second application of the third law
now yields Â¬ A false. We have thus arrived at both Â¬ A true and Â¬ A false, which is
impossible by the law of contradiction. The epistemic situation determined by the
three judgements above is hence impossible, which is to say that it is impossible to
fi nd a counterexample to the law of excluded middle in its positive formulation, and
this is precisely what the law of excluded middle in its negative formulation says:
tertium non datur.
